# Password Generator

## Description
I have developed a **Password Generator** that asks the user to designate the length of the password (8-128 characters) and then gives them options for what kind of characters to use (Special Characters, Numbers, Uppercase Letters, and Lowercase Letters).  The program then generates a random password of the selected length using `Math.random()` and the user-selected character set.  You can then copy this password to your clipboard by clicking the button that says *"Copy To Clipboard"*.
